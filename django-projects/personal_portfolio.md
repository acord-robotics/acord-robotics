Here's what we have to do to get the directory open:

(This assumes that the directory is C:\Users\droid\myproject\personal_portfolio, with "droid" being your username for your windows 10 device):

cd myproject
cd personal_portfolio

#23

I created the project "personal_portfolio" in the folder "myproject", which is a django app/project

We used `$ python3 -m venv venv` to create the virtual environment, but that's already been done, so to activate it we now have to do `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` --> because we're on Windows 10 rather than on Linux

To activate venv:
cd myproject
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Then we need to install django, which has already been done on this venv

Now we need to move into the `personal"_portfolio"` folder inside the myproject venv and execute this command:
`django-admin startproject personal_portfolio`

cd personal_portfolio

Then `python manage.py runserver`
