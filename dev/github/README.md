# Github

## Is Github Free?

There are a number of plans for Github, for example enterprise, but you can access all the features of Github \(private/public repositories, companies, issues, etc\), for free. Some of the apps/plug-ins that people create for Github cost money, but that money doesn't go to Github.

## What sort of things do we put on Github?

You can put any projects \(even if they're not to do with code\) on your personal github profile \(located at [http://github.com/\*\*your-username\*\*\](http://github.com/**your-username**\)\).

The ACORD Github group \([http://github.com/acord-robotics\](http://github.com/acord-robotics\)\) is for projects that are to do with ACORD. For example, if your department has a new robot they're working on, department specialists \(see the portal help section\) can create a repository for that project.

The repository has to be called **departmentname-projectname**, for example yearbook-2019yearbook.

### What are issues?

If there is a problem with code, you can create issues \(for example, "**fix character sprite**"\) that are related to commits/contributions. You can link these to milestones.

When you have an update on an issue \(for example, "working on it" or "completed", you can comment it on the issue thread. The issues area is sort of a forum as well.

If you have an update, please paste the commit link into your comment \(for example, **6EQUJ5** or [http://github.com/acord-robotics/reponame/blob/master/\_config-yml/commit//6equj5](http://github.com/acord-robotics/reponame/blob/master/_config-yml/commit//6equj5)\).
