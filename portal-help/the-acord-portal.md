# The ACORD Portal

## Navigation

The Portal is currently located at [http://allianceofdroids.org.au](http://allianceofdroids.org.au), however, once we've got our new domain name, we will be moving it to [http://portal.acord.org.au](http://portal.acord.org.au). [http://acord.org.au](http://acord.org.au) will be the landing page that will link to all the sites on the left \(the link titles will be different\).
