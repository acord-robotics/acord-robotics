# AC0/RD

ACORD Robotics is a software, scientific engineering and writing organisation that is based and was founded in Australia by Nicholas Antipas \(COO\) & Liam Arbuckle \(Chairman\), originally under the name Alliance of Droids. We create and contribute to open-source software that is used in scientific projects like the Open Source Rover by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

> Join a team full of talented individuals from around the globe. Chat, code, write, consume, repeat.



## Using this knowledge base

Everything that you need to know during your time as an AC0/RD member can be found here. This includes the project history, rules when committing to repositories on Github, how the network works and where to find certain things. Something important to remember is that the documentation for our _projects_ is located elsewhere, on the project page. 

### Project Documentation

![Exploring the documentation](.gitbook/assets/gitbook-sidebar.PNG)

The main documentation - where you're on right now - is labelled "1.0.0" and is at the top of the sidebar. To view documentation specific to a project, you can just click the button to navigate to the other projects. Project documentation is also available on the external project website. When brainstorming, logging and creating commits, we use the project _website_ for this purpose.  


## News & Media

We publish blog posts consistently on our main blog, http://blog.acord.software:

![Our blog in March 2020](.gitbook/assets/tumblr-blog1.PNG)

These are shared to our Facebook, Twitter, & Instagram profiles. We use Canva to create the cover images and Disqus for commenting. 

## Our Online Presence

We're visible on the main social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Tumblr. We also have profiles on version management services like Github & Gitlab. Our username is @ACORDRobotics

### Rules regarding social media

The following people currently have access to our social media profiles:

* Nicholas Antipas
* Liam Arbuckle \(Chairman\)
* Dylan Crowe \(CEO\)
* Rishabh Chakrabanty

You're free to tag @ACORDRobotics in your user profile on social media:

![Tagging us in your social media profiles](.gitbook/assets/gitbook-social.PNG)

You're also free to post about us on social media in the following circumstances:

* You write a post on our blog
* You contribute to one of our projects
* You are the receipient of a reward/award while working with us

Members are also free to gain access to our social media profiles if they write on our blog a lot, as getting our posts out to the public via Facebook & Twitter is incredibly important to our growth as a brand & as an identity.

## Community website

Our original website \(built with Wordpress\) was retired in January 2020, however we're still just as committed to ensuring that all of our services are integrated and that we have a fun & easy to use community section of our website.

The goal of this major project is to have a community website, with user profiles, a forum, groups and file sharing \(among other things - check out the great [Buddypress](http://buddypress.org) plugin\) that we can use for co-ordination of our projects, sharing & brainstorming ideas, and just communicating. We also want Github integrations with our website so that we can contribute from anywhere.

There's some great articles we've written on the blog about our goal:
