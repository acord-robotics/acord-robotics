# acord-robotics
The official ACORD Robotics (GENERAL) Repository

# What is this repo?

This repo is for all projects that aren't part of the following repos:

* Stellarios
* Star Sailors
* DroidOS (Archived)
* Acord News

An example of this would be stuff to do with members' personal journeys (for example, I'm going to be posting a lot of my computer science stuff here). While this stuff is beneficial for ACORD, it doesn't belong to any particular project.

If a part of this repo becomes a project (repository) in its own right, we will continue to update it on this repo as well, but the folder name will be changed to 'project_name_(archived)'.
